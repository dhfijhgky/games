// This is a macro I use on every single character I play (extensively). It's the result of several years of tweaking and works perfectly for me.

// The idea is that if there is a mouseover, we focus that. 
// If there is no mouseover but there is a target, we focus that instead. 
// If neither exist or we are holding shift or alt, we clear focus.

// If we're holding control, the target and focus are swapped. 
// This works with no focus or no target exactly as expected. 
// This took a lot of thought to make work within the boundaries of WoW macros and I'm excessively proud of it.
