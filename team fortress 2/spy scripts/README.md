In the context of Team Fortress 2, "scripts" generally refers to custom key binds.

I loved the Spy class and making scripts for it was one of my first "real" applications of code. This holds a lot of sentimental value to me.

Circa early 2012

modifiers.cfg was the base from which I built to allow ALT and CTRL as keybind modifiers (functionality not included in TF2 by default).

default.cfg was the base I used for every single class specific script. It generally dealt with determining what weapon viewmodels were visible when (on swap, on attack, etc), when auto-reloading was active, and making sure that swapping weapons worked as expected.

spy.cfg built on those two by adding custom disguise functionality. I didn't like having to bring up my kit and hitting one or two more buttons to get the disguise I wanted. I mapped every unique disguise to it's own combination of modifier + key (18 combinations in total).
